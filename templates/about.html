                Pune’s transportation system has developed gradually over the years. In the early 1940s, tangas were the only mode of transport. It was Pune Nagarpalika that conceived the idea of coming up with a public transport service. The dream took shape when the RTO permitted and M|s Silver Jubilee Motors was assigned the task. Back then there were just 4 routes with 20 buses plying across them. The fleet grew to 46 by 1948.
